# Contao news categories

This fork is based on [codefog/contao-news_categories](https://github.com/codefog/contao-news_categories) version `2.8.6` and provides several new functionalities.

## New features 

- primary category support (primary category can be set on news, otherwise first category in list is primary category)
- category jumpTo based on news_archive (can be set on each news category for each news archive)
- news url jumpTo based on news_archive and primary category (can be set on each news category for each news archive) -> news url will be linked to the primary category jumpTo page instead of archive jumpTo page
- news categories can now have a teaser (also based on news_archive, can be set on each news category for each news archive)
